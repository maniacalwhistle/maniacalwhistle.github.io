<p>A simple exercise to learn how to use Observable. The task is to plot perctange of organics collected per month by boro/district for past 5 years. Add dynamic filter by borough.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-data-dsny-monthly-tonnage-data">The Data: DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data</h2>
<p>NYC collects data on how much waste it collects from residences and institution per month. This data is open and available on the NYC Open Data portal, under <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5">DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data</a>. Waste is reported in tons and is categorized by type. The description for the different types of waste are listed in the documentation, so I’ll only list them here with a brief description.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refuse (trash)</li>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>MGP (metal, glass, plastic and beverage cartons)</li>
<li>Residential organics (food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste)</li>
<li>School organics (same as residential but from schools)</li>
<li>Leaves organics (leaves collected in Nov.&nbsp;and Dec.&nbsp;within certain neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Xmas Trees (Christmas trees)</li>
