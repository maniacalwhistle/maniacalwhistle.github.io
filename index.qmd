I work as a data scientist/analyst/etc. 

I compost over at [Abyssinian Tot Lot](https://goo.gl/maps/Hpu3NwBHmcsRtrR69) in Harlem. Recently "certified" as a [master composter](https://www.makecompost.nyc/mastercomposter).

I take care of some street trees near me from time to time as a NYC [super steward](https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship). 

I am working my way through Marie Simmons' [The Good Egg](https://bookshop.org/p/books/good-egg-more-than-200-fresh-approaches-from-breakfast-to-dessert-marie-simmons/11859628?ean=9780618711949) over at [@the pretty good egg](https://www.instagram.com/the_pretty_good_egg/)
