I work as a data analyst at [Inclusiv](https://inclusiv.org).  
I compost at [Abyssinian Tot Lot](https://goo.gl/maps/Hpu3NwBHmcsRtrR69).  
I take care of some street trees near me from time to time as a NYC [super steward](https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship). 
I maintain trails in [Highbridge Park](https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/highbridge-park)

My lifelong project is to cook every recipe in Marie Simmons' [The Good Egg](https://bookshop.org/p/books/good-egg-more-than-200-fresh-approaches-from-breakfast-to-dessert-marie-simmons/11859628?ean=9780618711949)
