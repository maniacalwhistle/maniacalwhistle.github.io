### Michael Sampson

I am data scientist by trade, a [master composter](https://www.makecompost.nyc/mastercomposter) and [super steward](https://www.nycgovparks.org/reg/stewardship) on the side. 

I am perpetually interested in, but never a master of, the metamagical programming language LISP and it's dialects/descendants.
